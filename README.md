# Rollup Learning

This is a repo that I created first time diving into Rollup.

[x] ~~[Rollup Tutorial](https://rollupjs.org/tutorial/).~~\
[x] ~~Hot Module Replacement.~~\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible with [nollup](https://github.com/PepsRyuu/nollup).\
[x] ~~Does Rollup need loaders like webpack?~~\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does. Rollup on its own is just an ESM bundler. But there are tons of plugins (that you can find [here](https://github.com/rollup/awesome?tab=readme-ov-file)) for extending Rollup's functionality.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• [rollup-plugin-bundle-html](https://github.com/haifeng2013/rollup-plugin-bundle-html)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• [css-only](https://github.com/thgh/rollup-plugin-css-only)\
[x] ~~Integration with Babel.~~\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• [@rollup/plugin-babel](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/babel)
[ ] Use Rollup in a project.
