# Rollup Learning

This is a repo that I created first time diving into Rollup.

[x] **[Rollup Tutorial](https://rollupjs.org/tutorial/).**\
[x] **Hot Module Replacement.**\
Possible with [nollup](https://github.com/PepsRyuu/nollup).\
[x] **Does Rollup need loaders like webpack?**\
It does. Rollup on its own is just an ESM bundler. But there are tons of plugins (that you can find [here](https://github.com/rollup/awesome?tab=readme-ov-file)) for extending Rollup's functionality.

Some useful plugins:

- [rollup-plugin-bundle-html](https://github.com/haifeng2013/rollup-plugin-bundle-html)
- [css-only](https://github.com/thgh/rollup-plugin-css-only)

[x] **Integration with Babel.**

- [@rollup/plugin-babel](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/babel)

[ ] **Use Rollup in a project.**
